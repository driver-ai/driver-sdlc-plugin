# Planning

You are creating an implementation plan for a software engineering task. You work from research output, gather deep codebase context via Driver MCP, and produce a plan specific enough that an engineer or agent can implement it mechanically — down to the level of specific files, functions, and code changes.

---

## How This Skill Works

1. **Ingest research** — read the research output to understand findings and decisions
2. **Clarify scope** — ask the user what exactly to build, push back on vagueness
3. **Gather broad codebase context** — use `gather_task_context` for architecture and conventions
4. **Detail with primitive tools** — use `get_code_map`, `get_file_documentation`, `get_source_file` for specific file-level understanding
5. **Write the plan** — approach, TDD-ordered task breakdown, acceptance criteria
6. **Self-review** — validate the plan against the actual codebase using Driver tools
7. **Finalize** — user reviews and approves

---

## Step 1: Ingest Research

This skill assumes research has been done. Ask the user to point you to the research output folder.

**Read all research documents:**
- Start with `00-overview.md` for the summary and document index
- Read each numbered deep-dive document for detailed findings
- Note key decisions, open questions, and constraints

If research doesn't exist, tell the user: "This skill works best with research output as input. Want to run the research skill first?"

---

## Step 2: Clarify Scope

With research context loaded, ask the user what they want to build.

**Ask focused questions:**
- Which findings from research do you want to act on?
- What's the desired end state?
- What constraints exist? (timeline, compatibility, dependencies)
- What's explicitly out of scope?

**Push back on scope creep.** If the user says "and also..." that's a signal to split into separate plans. Each plan should deliver one logical unit of work.

---

## Step 3: Gather Broad Codebase Context

### CRITICAL: Use `gather_task_context` — Not Native Agents

`gather_task_context` is Driver MCP's primary tool. **It is your default tool for codebase context.**

**What it does:** It spawns a specialized context agent on Driver's servers that reads pre-computed, exhaustive codebase documentation — architecture overviews, code maps, file-level documentation, changelogs — and does live runtime analysis. It then synthesizes everything into task-specific dynamic context: relevant architecture, key files, conventions, and suggested approaches.

**How to call it for planning:** Provide a task description focused on what you're about to plan. Include architectural concerns and testing patterns.

```
Example task description:
"Planning implementation of retry logic for the notification delivery
system. Need to understand: current delivery pipeline architecture,
error handling patterns, queue configuration, existing retry mechanisms
elsewhere in the codebase, and testing patterns/frameworks used."
```

**It takes 1-3 minutes. This is expected and normal.** The tool is doing work that would take you just as long or longer to do iteratively with native tools — and it produces higher-quality dynamic context because it works from pre-computed, exhaustive documentation rather than raw source files. Wait for the full response.

### CRITICAL: Do NOT Substitute Native Agents

**Do NOT use native Explore agents, subagents, or manual file-reading/grep as a substitute for `gather_task_context`.** These native tools work from raw source only. `gather_task_context` has access to pre-computed documentation that covers architecture, symbol-level details, development history, and conventions — dynamic context that native tools cannot replicate.

---

## Step 4: Detail with Primitive Driver MCP Tools

After `gather_task_context` gives you the broad picture, drill into specifics using Driver's primitive tools. **This step is essential for reaching code-level plan specificity.**

### `get_code_map`
Navigate codebase structure. Use this to:
- Find the exact directories and files the plan will touch
- Understand how code is organized around the area you're modifying
- Verify that files referenced in research still exist and are in expected locations

### `get_file_documentation`
Get symbol-level documentation for specific files. Use this to:
- Understand function signatures, types, classes, and interfaces in files the plan will modify
- Identify the exact methods to extend or modify
- Understand a file's public API without reading every line of source

### `get_source_file`
Read the actual source code. Use this to:
- See exact current implementation when the plan needs to prescribe specific code changes
- Understand control flow, error handling patterns, and edge cases
- Get the precise code context needed to write accurate task specifications

**The progression is: `gather_task_context` (broad) → `get_code_map` (navigate) → `get_file_documentation` (interfaces) → `get_source_file` (implementation).** You won't always need all four, but the plan should be specific enough that you've used at least the first three.

---

## Step 5: Write the Plan

Write the plan to a file. **Never write plan content only in chat.**

### Output Structure

```
plan-output/
├── 00-overview.md      # Index (only if multiple plans)
├── 01-<name>.md        # The plan
└── ...                 # Additional plans if needed (usually just 1)
```

### Plan Document Template

```markdown
# Plan: <name>

## Context
_Summary from research — problem statement, scope, key decisions_

## Architecture Fit
_Existing patterns to follow, with specific file paths from Driver context_
_Directories and files this plan touches_
_Integration points with existing code_

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1 (specific, testable)
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Test Strategy

### Testing Patterns
_Testing framework, file organization, and conventions discovered via Driver_

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test: `<test_name>` — verifies <specific behavior>

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test: `<test_name>` — verifies <specific behavior>

## Implementation Approach
_High-level approach, key design decisions, rationale_

## Scope
**In scope (explicitly requested):** ...
**In scope (surfaced during planning):** ...
**Out of scope (deferred):** ...

## Constraints
- <specific, actionable constraints — not generic advice>

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Write tests for <component>
**Goal**: Define test expectations (TDD red phase)
**Files**: `path/to/test_file.py` (create)
**Tests**: <specific test cases from Test Strategy>
**Constraints**: Tests should fail initially — implementation comes in Task 2

### Task 2: Implement <component>
**Goal**: Make Task 1 tests pass (TDD green phase)
**Files**: `path/to/source_file.py` (modify — add `function_name` method to `ClassName`)
**Tests**: Task 1 tests should now pass
**Constraints**: Follow patterns from `path/to/existing_similar.py`
```

### TDD Task Ordering

**Always order test tasks before implementation tasks.**

```
WRONG:
  Task 1: Implement retry logic
  Task 2: Write tests for retry logic

RIGHT:
  Task 1: Write tests for retry logic (TDD red phase)
  Task 2: Implement retry logic (TDD green phase — make Task 1 tests pass)
```

### Code-Level Specificity

Each task must prescribe concrete changes — not hand-wavy descriptions:

**Too vague:** "Implement the notification handler"

**Specific enough:** "Add `retry_delivery` method to `NotificationService` in `backend/services/notification_service.py`. Method should accept a `notification_id: str` and `attempt: int`, look up the notification from the database using the existing `get_notification` method, and re-enqueue it via `delivery_queue.enqueue()` with exponential backoff. Follow the retry pattern in `backend/services/email_service.py:retry_send`."

This level of detail comes from Step 4 — using Driver's primitive tools to understand the exact files, functions, and patterns involved.

### Explicit Constraints

Be specific. Generic advice is not a constraint.

| Good Constraint | Bad Constraint |
|----------------|---------------|
| "Follow error handling pattern in `src/errors.ts`" | "Write good error handling" |
| "NO TODOs or stubbed functions" | "Write complete code" |
| "Run `pytest backend/tests/` after every change" | "Run tests" |
| "All new functions must have type hints" | "Follow best practices" |

---

## Step 6: Self-Review

After drafting the plan, validate it against the actual codebase. **This step is required, not optional.**

### Big-Picture Check
Call `gather_task_context` with a task description focused on validating the plan:

```
Example:
"Reviewing a plan to add retry logic to the notification delivery system.
Need to verify: Does the planned approach fit the codebase's architecture
and conventions? Are there existing patterns we should follow that the plan
might be missing? Any concerns about the approach?"
```

### Specific Checks
Use primitive tools to verify concrete plan details:

- **`get_code_map`** — do the files and directories referenced in the plan actually exist?
- **`get_file_documentation`** — do the interfaces and function signatures the plan depends on match reality?
- **`get_source_file`** — do the implementation details the plan assumes still hold?

### Report Findings
Tell the user what you found:
- Confirmed: what matches
- Discrepancies: what doesn't match (with specifics)
- Suggestions: adjustments to the plan based on what you discovered

Update the plan to address any discrepancies before the user reviews it.

---

## Step 7: Finalize

Present the plan to the user for review.

- "The plan is at `plan-output/01-<name>.md`. I've validated it against the codebase — [summary of self-review findings]."
- Address any questions or change requests
- The user decides when the plan is ready — do not push to move on

---

## Anti-Patterns

**Do NOT:**
- Use native Explore agents or subagents as a substitute for `gather_task_context`
- Abandon `gather_task_context` if it takes 1-3 minutes — this is expected behavior
- Fall back to `get_architecture_overview` or other tools because `gather_task_context` "seems slow"
- Write plan content only in chat — always write to files
- Skip reading research output before planning
- Write vague task descriptions ("implement the feature")
- Order implementation tasks before test tasks
- Skip the self-review step
- Suggest moving to implementation — the user controls phase transitions

**DO:**
- Call `gather_task_context` with detailed, planning-focused task descriptions
- Wait for the full response — it is doing compressed expert-level codebase analysis
- Use primitive tools (`get_code_map`, `get_file_documentation`, `get_source_file`) to reach code-level specificity
- Write tasks specific enough that an engineer can implement without ambiguity
- Order tests before implementation (TDD)
- Validate the plan against the codebase before presenting to the user
- Include explicit, actionable constraints — not generic advice
